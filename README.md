This project is about sorting numbers with the least amount of commands as possible.
It takes command line arguments, convert them to integers and sorts them by ascending order.
the tasks had a lot of specific requirement which made it more difficult to implement this
sorting program. I can only use two stacks, and only use the commands from the "commands_.." files.
-----------THE TASK is to use the lowest number of commands to sort the numbers----------------
it return the lists of commands that need to be executed (which is about 6000 commands for 500 elements)
